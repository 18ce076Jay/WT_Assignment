                        Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and,
                        in<img src="Movie.jpg">turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular
                        entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis
                        of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide
                        attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other
                        languages.<br>

                                        stuntmen. They usually involve 'goodies' and 'baddies', so war and crime are
                                        common subjects. Action movies usually need very little effort to watch, since
                                        the plot is normally simple

                    <p>
                        User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for
                        machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic
                        devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience. The goal of user
                        interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms
                        of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design).<br><br>
                        Interface design is involved in a wide range of projects from computer systems, to cars, to
                        commercial planes; all of these projects involve much of the same basic human interactions yet
                        also require some unique skills and knowledge. As a result, designers tend to specialize in
                        certain types of projects and have skills centered on their expertise, whether it is a software
                        design, user research, web design, or industrial design.<br>

                    <p>
                        A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an
                        educational tool.[1] Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for
                        remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological
                        elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be
                        work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles
                        or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).<br><br><br>
                        Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve
                        mental or physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve
                        as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.

                        "History" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery,
                        collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events.
                        History also includes the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a
                        sequence of past events, and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that
                        determine them. Historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by
                        discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing
                        "perspective" on the problems of the present.
